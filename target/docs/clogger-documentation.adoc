= clogger Module Documentation Reference

+++
This is the main class of an extension, is the entry point from which configurations, connection providers, operations and sources are going to be declared.
+++


== Configurations
---
[[config]]
=== Config

+++
Default configuration
+++

==== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]
|======================
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | The name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Connection a| <<config_connection, Connection>>
 | The connection types that can be provided to this configuration. | | *x*{nbsp}
| Store Corelation a| Boolean |  |  +++false+++ | {nbsp}
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  +++Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before the runtime considers it eligible for expiration. This does not mean that the platform will expire the instance at the exact moment that it becomes eligible. The runtime will actually purge the instances when it sees it fit.+++ |  | {nbsp}
|======================

==== Connection Types
[[config_connection]]
===== Connection


====== Parameters
[cols=".^20%,.^20%,.^35%,.^20%,^.^5%", options="header"]

| Password a| String |  |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Table Name a| String |  |  | *x*{nbsp}
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  +++When the application is deployed, a connectivity test is performed on all connectors. If set to true, deployment will fail if the test doesn't pass after exhausting the associated reconnection strategy+++ |  | {nbsp}
|======================

==== Associated Operations
* <<logMesage>> {nbsp}



== Operations

[[logMesage]]
=== Log Mesage
`<c-logger:log-mesage>`

+++
Example of a simple operation that receives a string parameter and returns a new string message that will be set on the payload.
